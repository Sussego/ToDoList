# To-Do List

This is a simple to-do list application built with **React**. In this app, you can add, mark as complete, delete, and filter tasks. The project also uses **localStorage** to save tasks in the browser, ensuring tasks persist even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Allows you to add new tasks to the list.
- **Mark as Completed:** Clicking on a task will mark it as completed, striking through the text.
- **Remove Task:** Switches to a delete mode where you can remove tasks from the list.
- **Filter Tasks:** Displays tasks filtered by status (All, Pending, or Completed).
- **Local Storage:** Tasks are saved to **localStorage**, so they persist even after reloading the page.
